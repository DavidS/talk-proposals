David Schmitt, Principal Software Engineer at Puppet, is programming since high school in one way or another. Previously ruby and puppet for the Modules Team, now the Puppet Development Kit, and a new Puppet Resource API.

The Modules team at puppet is rsponsible for approximately 30 supported modules, all maintained on github. David will provide a short walk-through of how a a change makes its way from his laptop to the forge, the public module repository of puppet. Today we can release a hotfix release in a matter of minutes.

Along the way we'll see all the integrations, checks, and balances that make that possible:

* Ticketing with JIRA
* CI with Travis and Appveyor
* CI/CD with jenkins
* Hipchat integration for notification and ChatOps
* Changelog autogeneration

Time and interest permitting we can also go into the more advanced github features, which are not in use for modules development:

* issue templates: provide guidance for contributors
* protected branches and required checks: enforce merge policies
* projects and milestones: who needs JIRA anyways?
* github pages: free content hosting
