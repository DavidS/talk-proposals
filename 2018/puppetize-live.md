# Getting started with Module Development in 15 minutes

(25 minutes, live)

You won't believe what happened next! Getting your development environment for modules up and running was a daunting task. RVM vs rbenv, collecting All The Tools, choosing the right module template, adding CI on top, and keeping up-to-date with what's going on.

Not any more! With the Puppet Development Kit you can get started in a couple of minutes, and be up and running with a single package install.

In this talk, you'll get to see how to install and run the PDK, its capabilities, as well how to convert your existing modules so that they line up with the PDK.

A quick tour through how the Palo Alto module was built shows off some advanced use cases of the Resource API. By adding a little bit of information about the Palo Alto API to the types, the providers can rely on a common parese method to do the heavy lifting.

This segment will show how that looks like, and how this helped accelerate the development of the module.

# Writing agentless types with the Resource API

(25 minutes, live)

A deep dive into writing agentless types and providers with the PDK and the Resource API. This will specifically focus on the extended support for agentless management.

The `puppet device` command has been a hidden gem of the puppet ecosystem for too long. With the new Resource API, and more work done on the command itself, it is now ready for prime time.

In this talk we'll go through writing a quick and easy type and provider (a plugin to make new resources available to puppet for management) to manage Philips Hue lights with puppet through their API. After the talk you'll know how to get started with remote resources and agentless puppet.
